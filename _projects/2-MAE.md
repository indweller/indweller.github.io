title: "Masked Autoencoders for Adversarial Purification"
layout: talk
excerpt: "Designed and implemented an adversarial image purification model using fine-tuned Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) to restore perturbed images to their original form, rendering adversarial attacks ineffective. Conducted experiments on the ImageNet dataset, successfully mitigating adversarial attacks generated by Gaussian noise and the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). <br/> <img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
